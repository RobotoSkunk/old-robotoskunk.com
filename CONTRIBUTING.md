# Contribution Guidelines
All contributions are welcome! If you want to contribute, please read the following guidelines.

## How to contribute
If you want to contribute, you can do it in many ways:
- [Bugs and feature requests](#bugs-and-feature-requests)
- [Improve the code](#improve-the-code)
- [Translate the website](#translate-the-website)
- [Donate](#donate)

### Bugs and feature requests
If you find a bug or you want to request a new feature, please open an issue with the corresponding label.

Just make sure that the bug or feature request doesn't already exist.

### Improve the code
If you want to improve the code, you can do it in many ways:
- Fixing bugs
- Adding new features
- Improving the code quality

And we really need a better code quality because the code is not suitable for development.
Just remember to follow the [code style](CODING_STYLE.md) and the best practices.

### Translate the website
At the moment, there's no way to translate the website. A translation system is planned, but it's not ready yet.

### Donate
If you want to donate, please go to [robotoskunk.com](https://robotoskunk.com/) and scroll down to the footer.
There you'll find some donation buttons.
