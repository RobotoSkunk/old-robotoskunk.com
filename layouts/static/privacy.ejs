		<h2>YOUR LOGIN CREDENTIALS</h2>

		<p>Your login credentials are stored in the database in order to identify you when you log in. The password is stored in a hashed form using Argon2id, which is one of the most secure and up-to-date algorithm to hash passwords.
		<blockquote>
			Note: hashed means that there is no way to "decrypt" your password. Hash is different from encryption, because the encrypted data is possible to decrypt, while the hashed data is not because these are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" target="_blank">one-way algorithms</a>.
		</blockquote>
		<p>In the other hand, your email address is stored both hashed and encrypted. This is to protect your email address from being stolen in case of a database breach and to allow you to sign in.
		<p>RobotoSkunk is committed to using the most secure and up-to-date hashing algorithms to protect your data.

		<h2>YOUR SESSIONS DATA</h2>
		<p>When you log into the website, this website saves your session data in the database. This data is used to identify you when you log in and to control your access to the website. When you log out, this data is deleted permanently from the database.
		<p>The collected data is
		<ul>
			<li>the anonymized user agent (browser) you used to log in;
			<li>and the date and time when you logged in.
		</ul>
		<p>Every hour you are logged in, your session data is updated with the current user agent and the current date and time.
		<p>When you log in without using "Remember me", your session data is deleted after one hour of inactivity. When you log in using "Remember me", your session data is deleted after one month of inactivity to protect your account from unauthorized access.

		<h3>HCAPTCHA</h3>
		<p>We use the hCaptcha anti-bot service (hereinafter "hCaptcha") on our website. This service is provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation ("IMI").
		<p>hCaptcha is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a login page or contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program.
		<p>To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics.
		<p>This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled.
		<p>For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user).
		<p>The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to IMI. hCaptcha analysis in the "invisible mode" may take place completely in the background.
		<p>Website or app visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place if the user is not shown a challenge.
		<p>Data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (DSGVO): the website or mobile app operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam.
		<p>IMI acts as a "data processor" acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and a "service provider" for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
		<p>For more information about hCaptcha and IMI's privacy policy and terms of use, please visit the following links: <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy</a> and <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/terms" target="_blank">https://www.hcaptcha.com/terms</a>.
