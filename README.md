# [robotoskunk.com](https://robotoskunk.com)
Welcome to the public repository of RobotoSkunk's website!

This is just a connection repository between the frontend and backend part of
the entire website.


## Repositories
These are the repositories used to get this work, each one with their own
licenses and restrictions.

- [rs-web-client](https://github.com/RobotoSkunk/rs-web-client), the client side
    of robotoskunk.com.
- [rs-web-server](https://github.com/RobotoSkunk/rs-web-server), the server side
    of robotoskunk.com.

## Branches
This repository contains a set of abandoned branches that were planned for
future updates for robotoskunk.com before I decided to redo everything from
scratch and replacing the monolithic architecture with a microservices one.
