Welcome to the public repository of RobotoSkunk's website!

## WHY DID YOU MADE THIS??? ARE YOU CRAZY????
Well... yes. At the start, this website was planned to be just a closed-source website, but I decided to make it
open-source. Why? Because I love open-source, and I want to share my work with the world.

Also, this is a great oportunity to reach more people and hopefully someone would like to help me with this project.

### One more thing...
The code of this website is a complete mess. I've coded this website at the sime time I was learning how to code
in TypeScript; even the code doesn't follow the best practices. Don't worry, I'm working on it.

Also, I'm not a native english speaker, so if you find any grammar or spelling mistakes, please let me know!


## Requirements
- Node.js 18.15.0 or higher
- PostgreSQL 14.0 or higher
- TypeScript 5.0.2 or higher

Keep in mind that this project wasn't made to be an open-source project, so the code is a complete mess and
it doesn't follow the new coding standards.
